Artificial Intelligence Exercise
--------------------------------

Uninformed Search algorithms:
- BFS
- Uniform cost search
- DFS (Backtracing?)
- Depth limited DFS
- Iterative Deepening Search


Try solving the following problem(s):
- Search for a permutation of input characters to a valid word
- Search for a combination of input characters to a valid word
- Search for the longest/shortest possible valid word from combination / permutation
- Search for the longest possible word that contains all unique letters
